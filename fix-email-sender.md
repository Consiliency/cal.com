# Email Sender Name Issue Resolution

## Problem
Emails are being sent with "Jenner Torrence" as the sender name instead of "Frontier Strategies" as configured in EMAIL_FROM_NAME.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Environment Variable Configuration:**
   - `.env` has: `EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Frontier Strategies`
   - `.env.local` has: `EMAIL_FROM_NAME="Frontier Strategies Booking"`
   - Both should work, but emails are showing "Jenner Torrence"

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - Regular booking emails use: `from: \`${EMAIL_FROM_NAME} <${this.getMailerOptions().from}>\``
   - Workflow emails use: `from: \`${this.mailData.sender || SENDER_NAME} <${this.getMailerOptions().from}>\``
   - No workflows exist in the database currently

3. **Likely Issue:**
   The application is not loading the environment variables properly, causing EMAIL_FROM_NAME to be undefined and falling back to the default APP_NAME (which might be getting the user's name somehow).

## Solution

### Immediate Fix:
The issue is likely that the application isn't properly loading the EMAIL_FROM_NAME environment variable at runtime. Here's how to fix it:

1. **Update .env.local** (remove quotes if present):
   ```bash
   EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Frontier Strategies
   ```

2. **Restart the application with a clean state:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the current instance
   # Clear Next.js cache
   rm -rf .next
   # Restart
   yarn dev
   ```

3. **For production deployments**, ensure the environment variable is properly set:
   - If using Vercel/Netlify: Add EMAIL_FROM_NAME in the environment variables section
   - If self-hosted: Ensure the variable is exported before starting the app
   
### Alternative Solutions:

1. **If the issue persists**, the email service might be overriding the sender name:
   - Check your SMTP provider settings (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
   - Some providers require sender verification and use the verified name

2. **Create a custom email template** that explicitly sets the sender name

3. **Debug the actual value being used:**
   - Add logging to see what EMAIL_FROM_NAME resolves to at runtime
   - Check if any middleware or email service is modifying the headers

## Verification Steps

1. After making changes, send a test booking to verify the sender name
2. Check email headers to see the actual "From" field
3. If using SendGrid, check the SendGrid sender verification settings

## Additional Notes

- There are no workflows in the database, so the issue isn't from workflow-specific sender overrides
- The codebase correctly uses EMAIL_FROM_NAME constant
- The issue appears to be environment variable loading or email provider configuration
